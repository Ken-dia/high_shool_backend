# high_shool_backend
The Lycée d'Excellence de Dakar is today the best high school in Senegal for its quality of education and its results. We wish to innovate and continue to remain the leader by optimizing the entire educational process of the students and offering visibility to parents and the administration.



Mr. Demba Sarr, the director of the school, has called upon a software developer to set up a management application for him. He would like to have the possibility to add classes in the system. For example: Terminal S1, Terminal S2, Terminal L1a, Terminal L2b. He can also modify or delete any information concerning the classes.



To facilitate enrollment in his school, he would also like to have a part in the application where he can add students and put them in a specific class. For example. He can register his daughter Penda Sarr in Terminal s2.



Finally, for a first version of this platform he will need a part where he can list all the students and classes existing in his school.
